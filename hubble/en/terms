</div>
<div class="point"><h2>Article 1: Scope</h2>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The TCOU define the rights and obligations of the parties when using the Application. They form the basis of the contractual relationship between the Member and the company HAPPN.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>1.1 Conflicting Rules</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These Terms and Conditions of Use (TCOU) determine the main rules of use for the Application. They are accompanied by additional policies ‚Äì our Privacy Policy, our Confidence Charter and the Frequently-Asked Questions (FAQ) ‚Äì which provide the Member with clearer guidance on how to use the Application. In the event of a conflict between the various policies making the rules inaccessible, unintelligible or unpredictable, these TCOU shall prevail over the Privacy Policy, the Confidence Charter and the FAQ.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>1.2 Independence of Provisions</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Should any provision of these TCOU be declared invalid or inapplicable due to the effects of a law, regulation or ruling by a court with relevant jurisdiction, the other provisions shall remain effective and in force, unless these TCOU become distorted, or the obligations of the parties significantly thrown out of balance.</span></p>


</div>
<div class="point"><h2>Article 2: Amendments to the TCOU</h2>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>2.1 Updates</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Member will be informed of the updates on the Application and/or by e-mail to the address given by the Member. It is the Member‚Äôs responsibility to see that this e-mail address is valid.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is the Member‚Äôs responsibility to carefully read the updated TCOU and to be fully aware of any changes ensuing from said updates.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Complete acceptance of the changes is implied by the Member‚Äôs continued use of the Application‚Äôs Services following the updates.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Should the Member not agree with changes made to the TCOU, he or she has the option to end the Services and terminate the contractual relationship as per Article 16.3.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>2.2 Immediate Effect</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new TCOU shall be effective immediately for all Members.</span></p>

<div class="point"><h2>Article 3: Governing Law ‚Äì Dispute resolution</h2>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>3.1 Governing Law</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These TCOU shall be governed by French law.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>3.2 Dispute resolution</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Member will contact HAPPN first in order to try and find an amicable settlement to any dispute with HAPPN.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In case of failure, the Member is informed that he/she may choose to have recourse to mediation, free of charge, and submit its dispute to the Online Dispute Resolution platform proposed by the European Commission, which may be accessed at the following address: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/"><span class='s4'>http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/</span></a>. </span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before initiating such a mediation procedure, the Member must have submitted the dispute to HAPPN in writing in order to try and find an amicable settlement.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Any challenge or dispute related to the formation, interpretation, performance or expiry of these TCOU or in any connection therewith which has not been amicably settled shall be submitted to the appropriate courts of Paris.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Only certain customer service employees and authorized managers of HAPPN can process the personal data of the Members for the purpose described in Article 6.2. These employees and managers only have access to the data necessary to the performance of their duties.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN may also contract with authenticated, reliable subcontractors that may access, host and/or process some of the Member‚Äôs personal data on behalf of HAPPN under its instructions, in compliance with the Privacy Policy and guaranteeing the security and confidentiality of the Member‚Äôs personal data. These subcontractors primarily enable HAPPN to establish statistics on the traffic volume and/or the using of the Application and/or ensuring the smooth operation of the Service.</span></p>

It allows HAPPN to send promotional messages from advertisers and other partners via the Application. However, HAPPN never transfers any personal data of its Members to such advertisers and partners.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>6.3 Fair collection of personal data ‚Äì type of data</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Data related to the Member‚Äôs identity</b>: The registration form must be completed in order to access the Services, and HAPPN collects the data from Facebook, via Facebook Connect, to simplify the process. Members are required to provide some personal data when registering:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬† </span>Photos: the Member must at least provide their public Facebook profile picture. The Member then has the option of removing and/or adding other photos to his or her Account from his or her Facebook account or smartphone. For the sake of transparency, the published photos must represent the Member and should not mislead the other Members about his or her identity and/or physical appearance. These photos may not represent a famous person or include the image of a minor, and may not represent a racist, shocking, illegal or sexual message or contain personal information. The photos are published in the Application under the sole responsibility of the Member. By becoming a Member, the latter agrees to the publication of his or her photos on the Application.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬† </span>His or her date of birth (only the age calculated from the date of birth is visible on HAPPN)</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬† </span>His or her e-mail address (not visible to the public on HAPPN). The Member agrees to check that the email address taken off Facebook Connect is valid and/or to change it to facilitate communications with HAPPN.</span><span class="s2"></span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Any other personal information the Member enters in his or her Account is optional and entered at the Member‚Äôs sole discretion (directly or via Facebook Connect) and under his or her sole responsibility.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thus, a Member may authorize access to his or her list of Facebook friends so that when another Member views his or her profile, Member can see any mutual friends they may have.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Member may also provide HAPPN with a mobile phone number in order to receive text alerts. In all cases, the Member's e-mail address, surname and phone number shall not be visible or available to the public.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Facebook does not send any further data to HAPPN.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Location Data (geolocation)</b>: HAPPN‚Äôs primary function and goal is to enable Members to find the people they‚Äôve crossed paths with, in order to facilitate virtual or real life meet ups. The Member will be asked for permission to collect and process his or her geolocation in order to allow HAPPN to identify the crossing points with other Members who agreed to geolocation. The HAPPN news feed is created by these crossing points, displaying to the Member only profiles that he or she crossed paths with and that fit his or her criteria.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN may, with express consent, access the Member's position, approximately or more precisely depending on which technology is being used. HAPPN does not track the movements and/or itinerary of its Members, and the Member is reminded that HAPPN only keeps the crossing points between the Members.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">The exact position or the itinerary of the Member is never available to the other Members.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Member is free</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">to withdraw his or her consent at any time, and deactivate the geolocation technology on his smartphone. By doing so, the Member is preventing his or her news feed from being updated, and the Member will not see the other Members he or she has crossed paths with after the deactivation of the geolocation technology.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Transaction Data</b>: HAPPN does not collect or process any bank data. The Apple App Store, Google Play Store and the Windows Phone Store have opted to refrain from sending certain data to mobile applications, which includes any banking and financial information. Such data is collected and processed solely by the above platforms, and HAPPN does not have the option of changing this payment method.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Messaging Data</b>: Messaging data are sent and stored on HAPPN's servers solely in order to provide the service enabling conversations between Members who got a Crush. Messages and vocal messages are strictly private and involve only the Members in question.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN‚Äôs authorized managers are not entitled to read these conversations, except in case of judicial request and/or according to applicable provisions of law or regulations and/or<span class="Apple-converted-space">¬† </span>as a piece of evidence given to HAPPN by a Member as part of a report.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moreover, these strictly private Messages shall not be accessible to other Members who have not participated in such Messages, or to unregistered internet users or third parties.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Data related to research preferences</b>: By default the Application is set to research Members of the opposite gender (man &gt; woman - woman &gt; man) who are 18 to 70+ years old. The Member can modify and fill in the age range and gender of the people they are looking for (man and/or woman) in order to see only the profiles they have crossed paths with that fit their criteria. The Member will therefore only see on his or her newsfeed the Members with whom he crossed paths that fit his or her search criteria.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Mobile Data</b>: When the Member uses the Application, HAPPN collects server logs which may include information such as IP addresses, operating systems or application crashes. HAPPN cannot access its Members' browsing history.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>6.4 Further information concerning the data collected</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN ensures that the personal data the Member has published on the Application is entirely invisible to non-registered Internet users and third parties. HAPPN cannot be held liable for data published on its platform and disclosed by a Member.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Member's profile will not appear on the Application to Members with whom he or she has crossed paths but who are not compatible with his or her preferences.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>6.5 Sensitive Data</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Certain data is legally classified as ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù pursuant to Article 8 of the French Act n¬∞ 78-17 of January 6, 1978, known as the Loi Informatique et Libert√©s (French Data Protection Act).</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When registering on the Application, the Member may decide to provide sensitive data about himself or herself under his or her description such as, for example, ethnic origin, sexual orientation or political views.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN does not encourage Member to disclose sensitive data to other Members or to HAPPN. Nevertheless, if the Member is willing to disclose such data in his or her profile, the disclosure is taken to be an express consent to the collection and processing of these data by HAPPN.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>6.6 Member‚Äôs Rights</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In accordance with the Loi Informatique et Libert√©s (French Data Protection Act), each Member has the right to access, correct and contest his or her personal data. HAPPN is attentive to its Members‚Äô concerns, and therefore undertakes to comply with personal data protection rules and deal with requests of this kind as soon as possible. Subject to proof of identity, Members may exercise their rights by sending a letter or an e-mail to the address shown in Article 17 of these TCOU.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ The right to access allows the Member to ask HAPPN for data pertaining to him or her in an accessible format, based on Article 39 of the Loi Informatique et Libert√©s (French Data Protection Act).</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ The right to correct grants the Member the right to demand the correction, the addition, the update or the deletion of any personal data pertaining to him or her which is inaccurate, incomplete, ambiguous, out-of-date, or whose use, communication or storage is prohibited based on Article 40 of the Loi Informatique et Libert√©s (French Data Protection Act).</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These rights may only be exercised within the limits of HAPPN‚Äôs resources as regards its linking with Facebook Connect. Some of the data are sent to HAPPN by Facebook Connect and cannot be corrected without Facebook's assistance.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Member can at his or her initiative rectify most of his or her personal data on the Application.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>6.7 Lack of cession of your personal data</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Personal data, whether visible or not to the other Members, are not licensed nor given by HAPPN to third parties.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>6.8 Storage of personal Data</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN will store the Member's personal data for as long as required in order for the Member to use his or her Account.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furthermore, please note that in accordance with its status as a hosting provider, HAPPN has a legal obligation to retain some of Members' personal data for a period of one year based on Article 6, II of the Loi pour la Confiance dans l‚ÄôEconomie Num√©rique of June 21, 2004 (French Trust in the Digital Economy Act).</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pursuant to the Decree of February 25, 2011 pertaining to the retention and communication of data, the retention period applied to HAPPN is calculated from the moment the content is created for data referred to by 1¬∞ and 2¬∞ of Article 6, II of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act, i.e.:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ The username used to log in which is at the source of the communication;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ The operation dates and times;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ The username used by the originator of the operation if provided by the latter.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The retention period applied to HAPPN is calculated from the moment the agreement is cancelled or the Account is deleted for the data referred to by 3¬∞ of the same Article, i.e.:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ First names and surnames</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ Any aliases used</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ Linked e-mail addresses or Accounts</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ Phone numbers</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ The password and data used to verify or amend the Account (most recent version).</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN agrees to make every effort and to invest all means at its disposal in order to guarantee that the stored data are as secure as possible. It is however the Member's responsibility to take appropriate action in order to protect his or her data outside of HAPPN‚Äôs scope.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN does not collect data from minors. Should a Member lie about his or her date of birth, and particularly if he or she fraudulently claims to be over 18 years of age, the parents of the minor in question may inform HAPPN of this by sending a letter to the address shown in Article 17 in order to request that the data be deleted. HAPPN agrees to delete all data concerning the minor in question as soon as possible.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>6.9 Transfer of Data outside the EU</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When registering, the Member expressly consents to his or her data being transmitted to subcontractors, and hosted on servers owned by our service providers outside the European Union, for the proper provision of the service, for the purpose of performing statistical studies and for the purpose of providing customer care support to Members.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN guarantees that the transfers are made under conditions ensuring the confidentiality and security of the data and providing for an adequate level of protection with respect to the Article 68 and 69 of the Loi Informatique et Libert√©s (French Data Protection Act).</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>7.1 CNIL</b>¬†<b>Declaration</b></span></p>

<div class="point"><h2>Article 8: HAPPN's Obligations and Liability</h2>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>8.1 Technical Resources and Security</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN agrees to provide the infrastructure and technical resources to provide a high-quality Service to Members with an iPhone device running operating system version IOS 8 or higher, an Android Smartphone running version 4.1 or higher, or a Windows Phone running version 8.1 or higher.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN cannot be held liable for any operating fault on the Member's device or for any compatibility issue between the Application and the device.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every effort is made to ensure that the risks of fraudulent access to HAPPN's system are minimized. HAPPN therefore uses a firewall or equipment located between the internet and the Company's private network, in order to make its security more robust by filtering traffic to and from the internet. It is, however, impossible to fully guarantee the security of a network.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN is not responsible for any failures, interruptions or poor performance of the Member's internet provider services, or for any cause beyond HAPPN's control which might interrupt or have an adverse effect on access to HAPPN Services.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Member must have access to a secure e-mail account. If such a precaution is not taken, or even if it is, the Member's Account may, in some rare cases, be targeted by fraudsters.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN shall also endeavor to avert any exceptional risk to Members of receiving spam Messages or Messages claiming to have been sent by HAPPN. The Member must ensure that he or she reports any of the above circumstances to HAPPN by sending a letter or e-mail to the address provided in Article 17 hereof.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>8.2 Illegal Conduct</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN and its partners cannot be held liable for actions by its Members which are illegal or which incur criminal penalties, including but not limited to:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ All types of scams</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ Prostitution</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ Identity theft</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ An infringement of a third party intellectual property right.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>8.3 Reporting and Community Moderation System</b></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a hosting provider and pursuant to Article 6, I, 7¬∞ of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act, HAPPN has no legal obligation to monitor the content sent or stored via the Application.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, according to Article 6-I-3¬∞ of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act, HAPPN must set up a reporting and community moderation system in order to report some illegal, abusive and prejudicial content.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In such case and after due verification by customer service, HAPPN commits to promptly remove the said content.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pursuant to Article 6-I-5 of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act: The knowledge of illicit content is deemed effective when the hosting provider is notified of following:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ The notification date</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s3">‚Ä¢ </span><span class="s1">The content transmitter‚Äôs identity</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s3">‚Ä¢ </span><span class="s1">The description of the facts in contention (possibly with screen shots of the conversation)</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s3">‚Ä¢ </span><span class="s1">The reasons of the reporting</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HAPPN has therefore set up a reporting and community moderation system allowing Members to report the content described in Article 6-I-7¬∞ of the French Trust in the Digital Economy Act if it constitutes apology for crimes against humanity, apology for and incitement to terrorism, incitement to racial hatred, incitement to hatred based on gender, sexual orientation or handicap and inter alia child pornography, incitement to violence against women and violation of human dignity.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guided by an extremely strict professional ethic and refusing any association with violent or insulting Members as well as illegal, abusive or prejudicial content, HAPPN‚Äôs team takes this reporting procedure very seriously.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hence, when the content published by a Member is reported, the transmitter‚Äôs account can be removed or suspended according to the conditions set forth in Article 16.4. This decision is based on the proof given by the report‚Äôs author and is made in order to ensure the withdrawal of any illegal content in compliance with HAPPN‚Äôs legal obligations.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Member having originally published the reported content will be informed of such a decision on the Application and/or by e-mail at the address given. He or she will in no case be informed of the identity of the report‚Äôs author.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Outside the scope of this reporting system, the Member can decide to block another Member in order to prevent any conversation with him or her (mutual prevention of access to Like, Chat request, Messages and voice messages that have been sent and of sending any messages in the future, or being alerted of the presence of a Member who has been blocked, particularly if they think this Member is bothering them in one way or another). It is possible, however, to unblock the Member free of charge in order to be in touch with him or her again. This action is confidential and enables Members to control the Members with whom they want to keep in touch or not.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This reporting system is available and operational:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ On an iPhone: at the bottom right of the Member's profile photo, and at the top right of the conversation with the Member in question;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ On a Smartphone: at the bottom right of the Member's profile photo, and at the top right of the conversation with the Member in question;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‚Ä¢ On a Windows phone: at the bottom right of the Member's profile photo, and at the bottom right of the conversation with the Member in question.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Should content be published that was reported and that may be seen as a violation of law or regulations, the Member who is a victim of this content is encouraged to submit a complaint to the appropriate police authorities.</span></p>


<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reporting system put in place by HAPPN does not replace any complaint and judicial procedure against a Member who authored the reported content.</span></p>
